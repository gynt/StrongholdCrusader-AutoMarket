# Auto market

## Usage
During the game hit ALT+M to open the AutoMarket overlay.
Settings are saved globally, not per save game.  
The "Enabled" status is not saved and must be re-enabled each game to prevent accidental buyings/sellings due to global settings.

The AutoMarket deducts a <ins>transaction fee of 10%</ins> on each buying/selling by default. This can be changed through the automarket.json that is generated on first usage.
